# DESCRIPTION
# This algorithm is widely used to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum.
# The simple idea of Kadaneâ€™s algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array (max_ending_here is used for this).
# And keep track of maximum sum contiguous segment among all positive segments (max_so_far is used for this).
# Each time we get a positive-sum compare it with max_so_far and update max_so_far if it is greater than max_so_far .
# It can be viewed both as a greedy and DP problem.
